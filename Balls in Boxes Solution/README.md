**Simple Example:**

Suppose that you have 2 identical balls and 2 empty boxes. You randomly put every ball into some box. What is the probability that none of the boxes have more than 1 balls?

                            [0][0]
                               ^
                      [1][0].    [0][1]   
                     ^.                ^.
               [2][0]. [1][1].   [1][1]. [0][2].


P(11) = 0.5 P(20) = .25 P(02) = .25

P(max number of balls is 1) = .5

Note: Number of outcomes that meet condtions / Number of outcomes = 1/3, this is wrong as it assumes all outcomes have the same probability of happeing. This error has constantly been made my mathametitions thoughout history. I like to think of it as the Boseâ€“Einstein error.

You may also notice this looks simmilar to a binomial distribution, or a coin flip where box 1 is heads and box 2 is tails and number of balls is number of trials. This is correct. So why not just use the bimomial formula? 

You could use the binomial formula to calcuate this answer and would get the same result. The problem occurrs when you add a third box. Then it is no longer a binomial distribution but a multinomial distribution. (bi menas two). For example:

Suppose that you have 3 identical balls and 3 empty boxes. You randomly put every ball into some box. What is the probability that one box will contain all 3 balls?

Same question: Suppose that you have 3 sided die and roll the die 3 empty times. What is the probability that all three rolls will be the same?

The binomial formula gets (1-(1/27))^3=0.892. This is close to the right answer, but not right because a binomial distribution requires the boxes to be independed of one another, and with 3 boxes or a 3 sided die, they are not. 

The correct answer to this is 1 - 3/27 = 0.88888888888888
