**Simple Example:**

Suppose that you have 2 identical balls and 2 empty boxes. You randomly put every ball into some box. What is the probability that none of the boxes have more than 1 balls?

                            [0][0]
                               ^
                      [1][0].    [0][1]   
                     ^.                ^.
               [2][0]. [1][1].   [1][1]. [0][2].


P(11) = 0.5 P(20) = .25 P(02) = .25

P(max number of balls is 1) = .5
